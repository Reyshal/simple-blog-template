A new responsive web project with SASS

## How it was started

This is one of my project to learn how responsive web work, so i followed tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvUrASNj0s. I use SASS because i also want to learn it, it took me a lot of time to understand it ^^'. Although that the tutorial is 4 hour long, somehow it me 4 days to finish it. But im happy how it look and hopefully i can learn much more to be frontend developer.
